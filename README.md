# SWOT_CalVal_StructureFunctions
Scripts (no data) for "Sub-100 km ocean processes revealed by structure functions of SWOT sea surface height and in situ observing network" (in prep/review). Not final. Some scripts may be redundant and/or contain unused sections.

Before a permanent archive is created for data used in this study, SWOT and mooring data are available at https://zenodo.org/records/14675995 and mooring data at

If something seems to be missing, please contact the editor in order to maintain anonymity; I will try to get back to any requests for missing scripts or needed data as soon as possible!
